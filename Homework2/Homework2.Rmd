## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
class_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaitelmouden/DATA621/master/Homework2/classification-output-data.csv")

exp_val <- class_df$class
pred_val <- class_df$scored.class
```


```{r}
table_class <- table(exp_val, pred_val)
colnames(table_class) <- c("False", "Positive")
rownames(table_class) <- c("False", "Positive")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
