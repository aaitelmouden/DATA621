```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(RCurl)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Loading the data

```{r}
class_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaitelmouden/DATA621/master/Homework2/classification-output-data.csv")

exp_val <- class_df$class
pred_val <- class_df$scored.class
```

2. Using the table() function to create a confusion matrix

```{r}
table_class <- table(pred_val, exp_val)
#colnames(table_class) <- c("Negative", " Positive")
#ownames(table_class) <- c("Negative", "Positive") I'm having a hard time coming up with the right labels
table_class
```
In the output above, the rows represent the predicted values for the class of each observation (ie. the scored.class value), while the columns represent the actual values for class. Thus, the first quadrant is the true negatives, the second quadrant is the number of False Negatives, the third quadrant is the number of False Positives, while the fourth quadrant is the number of True Positives.

3. Write a function for accuracy

```{r}
calculate_accuracy <- function(df){
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1) 
  TN <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  (TP + TN)/nrow(df)
}

calculate_accuracy(class_df)

```

4. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the classification error rate of the predictions.

```{r}
calc_error_rate <- function(df){
   FP <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1) 
   FN <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
   (FP + FN)/nrow(df)
}

calc_error_rate(class_df)
```

5. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the precision of the predictions.
```{r}
calc_precision <- function(df){
  FP <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TP/(TP +FP)
}

calc_precision(class_df)
```


6. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the sensitivity of the predictions. Sensitivity is also known as recall.

```{r}
calc_sensitivity <- function(df){
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  FN <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  TP/(TP + FN)
}

calc_sensitivity(class_df)
```

7. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the specificity of the predictions.

```{r}
calc_specificity <- function(df){
  FP <- sum(class_df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TN <- sum(class_df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  TN/(TN + FP)
}

calc_specificity(class_df)
```

8. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the F1 score of the predictions.
```{r}
calc_f1 <- function(df){
  (2* calc_precision(df)*calc_sensitivity(df))/(calc_precision(df) + calc_sensitivity(df))
}

calc_f1(class_df)
```

9. Before we move on, let’s consider a question that was asked: What are the bounds on the F1 score? Show
that the F1 score will always be between 0 and 1. (Hint: If 0 < 𝑎 < 1 and 0 < 𝑏 < 1 then 𝑎𝑏 < 𝑎.)


10. Write a function that generates an ROC curve from a data set with a true classification column (class in our
example) and a probability column (scored.probability in our example). Your function should return a list that includes the plot of the ROC curve and a vector that contains the calculated area under the curve
(AUC). Note that I recommend using a sequence of thresholds ranging from 0 to 1 at 0.01 intervals.


11. Use your created R functions and the provided classification output data set to produce all of the
classification metrics discussed above.



12. Investigate the caret package. In particular, consider the functions confusionMatrix, sensitivity, and
specificity. Apply the functions to the data set. How do the results compare with your own functions?




13. Investigate the pROC package. Use it to generate an ROC curve for the data set. How do the results
compare with your own functions?
