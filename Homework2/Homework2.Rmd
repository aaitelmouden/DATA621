```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(RCurl)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

```


1. Loading the data

```{r}

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaitelmouden/DATA621/master/Homework2/classification-output-data.csv")

```

2. Using the table() function to create a confusion matrix

```{r}
data_table <- table(data$class, data$scored.class)

data_table
```
In the output above, the rows represent the predicted values for the class of each observation (ie. the scored.class value), while the columns represent the actual values for class. Thus, the first quadrant is the true negatives, the second quadrant is the number of False Negatives, the third quadrant is the number of False Positives, while the fourth quadrant is the number of True Positives.

3. Write a function for accuracy

```{r}

calculate_accuracy <- function(df){
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1) 
  TN <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  (TP + TN)/nrow(df)
}

calculate_accuracy(data)

```

4. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the classification error rate of the predictions.

```{r}
calc_error_rate <- function(df){
   FP <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1) 
   FN <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
   (FP + FN)/nrow(df)
}

calc_error_rate(data)
```

5. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the precision of the predictions.

```{r}
calc_precision <- function(df){
  FP <- sum(df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TP/(TP +FP)
}

calc_precision(data)
```


6. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the sensitivity of the predictions. Sensitivity is also known as recall.

```{r}

calc_sensitivity <- function(df){
  TP <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  FN <- sum(df$class == 1 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  TP/(TP + FN)
}

calc_sensitivity(data)
```

7. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the specificity of the predictions.

```{r}
calc_specificity <- function(df){
  FP <- sum(class_df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 1)
  TN <- sum(class_df$class == 0 & class_df$scored.class == 0)
  TN/(TN + FP)
}

calc_specificity(data)
```

8. Write a function that takes the data set as a dataframe, with actual and predicted classifications identified,
and returns the F1 score of the predictions.
```{r}
calc_f1 <- function(df){
  (2* calc_precision(df)*calc_sensitivity(df))/(calc_precision(df) + calc_sensitivity(df))
}

calc_f1(data)
```

9. Before we move on, let’s consider a question that was asked: What are the bounds on the F1 score? Show
that the F1 score will always be between 0 and 1. (Hint: If 0 < 𝑎 < 1 and 0 < 𝑏 < 1 then 𝑎𝑏 < 𝑎.)

```{r}

# To show this, we are going to use uniform distribution with function runif to generate random deviates
# Then run the calc_f1 function and show that min and max values of f1_score will always fall are within 0 and 1

# let pre be the precision and sens be the sensitivity (values in percent/between 0 and 1)

pre <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 1)
sens <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 1)

f1_score <- (2 * pre * sens) / (pre + sens)

summary(f1_score)


```


10. Write a function that generates an ROC curve from a data set with a true classification column (class in our
example) and a probability column (scored.probability in our example). Your function should return a list that includes the plot of the ROC curve and a vector that contains the calculated area under the curve
(AUC). Note that I recommend using a sequence of thresholds ranging from 0 to 1 at 0.01 intervals.


```{r}

ROC_function <- function(df){
  
  # Select the needed variables
  
  df <- select(df, class, scored.probability)
  
  x <- df$class
  y<- df$scored.probability
  
  # Calculate TPR and FPR
  
  x <- x[order(y, decreasing = TRUE)]
  
  TPR <- cumsum(x) / sum(x)
  FPR <- cumsum(!x) / sum(!x)
  
  # Calculate AUC
  
  # New df
  
  df <- data.frame(TPR, FPR, x)
  
  
  # Inputs already sorted, best scores first
  
  df_FPR <- c(diff(df$FPR), 0)
  df_TPR <- c(diff(df$TPR), 0)
  
  #  AUC = total area is the dot product of these vectors
  
  AUC <- round(sum(df$TPR * df_FPR) + sum(df_TPR * df_FPR)/2, 4)
  
  # Plot the curve
  
  g <- ggplot(df, aes(FPR, TPR)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("ROC Curve") +
    xlab("FP Rate") + ylab("TP Rate")
  
  
  # Return a list
  
  return(list(plot=g, AUC=AUC))
  
}

# Call the function with our data frame

ROC_function(data)


```



11. Use your created R functions and the provided classification output data set to produce all of the
classification metrics discussed above.


```{r}






```


12. Investigate the caret package. In particular, consider the functions confusionMatrix, sensitivity, and
specificity. Apply the functions to the data set. How do the results compare with your own functions?


```{r}





```



13. Investigate the pROC package. Use it to generate an ROC curve for the data set. How do the results
compare with your own functions?
